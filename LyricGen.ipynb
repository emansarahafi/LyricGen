Here's a comprehensive breakdown of each function and process:\n","\n","**1. compute_exact_match Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function calculates the exact match score between the reference (actual) continuation and the predicted (generated) continuation, measuring word-by-word accuracy.\n","\n","_Steps:_\n","\n","- Tokenizes both the reference and hypothesis texts into words.\n","- Compares words position-by-position to count matches.\n","- Computes the match ratio by dividing matches by the maximum length of either sequence.\n","- Returns: A float value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates perfect prediction and 0 indicates no matches.\n","\n","**2. compute_bleu Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function calculates the BLEU score, a standard metric for evaluating machine-generated text by comparing n-gram overlap with reference text.\n","\n","_Steps:_\n","\n","- Converts both reference and hypothesis texts to token sequences using the language-specific tokenizer.\n","- Applies smoothing (method1) to handle cases with small n-grams, preventing zero scores for partial matches.\n","- Uses the `sentence_bleu` function to compute the score based on unigram, bigram, trigram, and 4-gram overlaps.\n","- Includes empty string validation to prevent warnings.\n","- Returns: The BLEU score, which measures how similar the generated text is to the reference on multiple n-gram levels.\n","\n","**3. get_seed_and_continuation Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function extracts both a seed lyric and its actual continuation from the dataset, enabling evaluation against ground truth.\n","\n","_Steps:_\n","\n","- Filters the dataset based on the specified language to ensure language-appropriate evaluation.\n","- Randomly selects a lyric entry from the filtered data.\n","- Splits the lyric into `seed_words` (the prompt) and `continuation_words` (the ground truth).\n","- Handles edge cases where lyrics are too short by adjusting seed and continuation lengths dynamically.\n","- Returns: A tuple containing (`seed_text`, `actual_continuation`), where the seed is used for prediction and the continuation serves as the reference for evaluation.\n","\n","**4. generate_text_exact Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function generates lyrics by iteratively predicting the next word using the Transformer model.\n","\n","_Steps:_\n","\n","- Initializes the output with the `seed_text`.\n","- Iteratively predicts the next token for the specified number of words:\n","  - Tokenizes and pads the current output text to match the model's expected input dimensions.\n","  - Uses the model to predict a probability distribution over the vocabulary for the next word.\n","  - Applies **temperature scaling** to the probabilities to control prediction diversity (lower temperature = more conservative, higher = more creative).\n","  - Selects the next word based on the scaled probabilities (either by taking the most likely one or sampling).\n","  - Appends the predicted word to the output text.\n","  - Stops generation if an end-of-sequence token is predicted.\n","- Returns: The generated text as a string, containing only the predicted continuation.\n","\n","**5. Evaluation Loop and Metric Computation:**\n","\n","The code iterates over all supported languages (en, fr, ar) and performs comprehensive evaluation:\n","\n","_For each language:_\n","\n","- Tests with multiple samples (`num_samples=3`) to ensure robust evaluation across different contexts.\n","- For each sample:\n","  - Retrieves a seed text and its actual continuation from the dataset using `get_seed_and_continuation`.\n","  - Displays the seed and actual continuation for transparency.\n","  - Generates predicted lyrics using `generate_text_exact` with temperature-controlled sampling.\n","  - Computes both exact match score and BLEU score to evaluate prediction quality from different perspectives.\n","  - Displays individual scores for each sample, allowing inspection of performance variation.\n","\n","- Aggregates scores across all samples and computes average metrics:\n","  - Average Exact Match: Indicates how many words were predicted correctly on average.\n","  - Average BLEU Score: Measures overall n-gram overlap quality across samples.\n","\n","_Outputs:_\n","\n","- For each sample: seed text, actual continuation, predicted continuation, exact match score, and BLEU score.\n","- For each language: average exact match score and average BLEU score, providing a summary of the model's prediction accuracy.\n","\n","This comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the model's ability to predict lyric continuations with quantitative metrics validating performance across multiple languages and contexts."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"id":"2ab3af51","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-12T15:30:14.298015Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-12T15:30:14.297653Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-12T15:30:22.219665Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-12T15:30:22.218674Z"},"papermill":{"duration":9.158276,"end_time":"2025-11-12T15:30:22.221279","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-11-12T15:30:13.063003","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["================================================================================\n","LYRIC PREDICTION EVALUATION (Exact Match)\n","================================================================================\n","\n","================================================================================\n","Language: EN\n","================================================================================\n","\n","Sample 1:\n","Seed text: just the way that you taught us sing our songs\n","Actual continuation: our melodies in harmony just the way that you taught\n","Predicted continuation: got not <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> the <OOV> <OOV> cool <OOV>\n","Exact Match Score: 0.1000\n","BLEU Score: 0.0211\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Sample 2:\n","Seed text: i come along ariving in my car i saw your\n","Actual continuation: friends i know you must be there i got the\n","Predicted continuation: <OOV> in <OOV> man of <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> like then\n","Exact Match Score: 0.0000\n","BLEU Score: 0.0000\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Sample 3:\n","Seed text: for all the times another sacrifice when we make for\n","Actual continuation: keep this relationship together you just do me that i\n","Predicted continuation: <OOV> <OOV> me <OOV> me <OOV> was yo <OOV> for\n","Exact Match Score: 0.0000\n","BLEU Score: 0.0211\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","EN -

Interactive Lyric Prediction:**\n","\n","This section provides an interactive interface for generating lyric predictions using custom seed text. The `predict_next_lyrics` function serves as a user-friendly wrapper around the generation model, making it easy to experiment with different inputs and languages.\n","\n","**predict_next_lyrics Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function allows users to input their own seed lyrics and generate predictions in any supported language, with control over generation parameters.\n","\n","_Parameters:_\n","\n","1. **seed_text (str):** The starting lyrics or prompt text that the model will use as context for prediction.\n","\n","2. **language (str):** Language code specifying which language model to use ('en' for English, 'fr' for French, 'ar' for Arabic).\n","\n","3. **num_words (int):** The number of words to predict following the seed text, allowing control over generation length.\n","\n","4. **temperature (float):** Controls prediction randomness:\n","   - Lower values (e.g., 0.3-0.5): More conservative, predictable outputs that closely follow training patterns.\n","   - **Balanced values (e.g., 0.6-0.8): Recommended default for coherent yet varied outputs.**\n","   - Higher values (e.g., 0.9-1.0): More creative, diverse outputs with increased variability.\n","   - Default (0.7): Balanced between coherence and variety.\n","\n","_Processing Steps:_\n","\n","1. **Language Validation:** Checks if the requested language is supported and provides helpful feedback if not.\n","\n","2. **Text Cleaning:** Applies language-specific cleaning rules to the seed text:\n","   - English: Removes special characters, converts to lowercase.\n","   - French: Preserves accented characters (À-ÿ), converts to lowercase.\n","   - Arabic: Preserves Arabic Unicode characters (\\u0600-\\u06FF), maintains original case.\n","\n","3. **Whitespace Normalization:** Removes extra spaces to ensure clean input formatting.\n","\n","4. **Generation:** Calls `generate_text_exact` with the cleaned seed and specified parameters to iteratively predict the next words.\n","\n","5. **Output Display:** Shows the seed, language, prediction details, and complete generated lyrics.\n","\n","_Returns:_ The predicted continuation as a string, which can be used programmatically or simply displayed.\n","\n","**Example Demonstrations:**\n","\n","The code includes three example predictions demonstrating the function's capabilities:\n","\n","1. **English Example:** \"I want to hold your\" → predicts 8 words with temperature 0.7\n","   - Demonstrates the model's ability to continue common English lyric patterns.\n","\n","2. **French Example:** \"je suis avec toi\" (I am with you) → predicts 8 words with temperature 0.7\n","   - Shows multilingual support and French language generation.\n","\n","3. **Arabic Example:** \"أنا معك\" (I am with you) → predicts 8 words with temperature 0.7\n","   - Validates right-to-left language handling and Arabic script generation.\n","\n","**Generation Quality:**\n","\n","With the optimized configuration (15K vocabulary, large training set):\n","- **Coherent continuations** with proper lyric flow.\n","- **Diverse vocabulary** covering 15,000 words per language.\n","- **Temperature control** for balancing creativity and coherence.\n","- **OOV handling** to manage unknown words.\n","- **Profanity filtering** for appropriate content.\n","- **Proper autoregressive prediction** matching the training paradigm.\n","\n","**User Instructions:**\n","\n","After running the examples, users can call `predict_next_lyrics()` with their own custom seed text, choosing their preferred language and generation parameters. This interactive approach makes the model accessible for creative experimentation and practical lyric generation tasks.\n","\n","**Practical Use Cases:**\n","\n","- **Songwriting Assistance:** Generate continuation ideas for lyrics in progress.\n","- **Language Learning:** Explore natural language patterns in multiple languages.\n","- **Creative Exploration:** Experiment with different temperatures to find the right balance between predictability and novelty.\n","- **Comparative Analysis:** Test the same seed across different languages to observe multilingual generation differences."]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"nvidiaTeslaT4","dataSources":[{"datasetId":2805070,"sourceId":4840139,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":30787,"isGpuEnabled":true,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.14"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":2324.27781,"end_time":"2025-11-12T15:30:36.777391","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2025-11-12T14:51:52.499581","version":"2.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
