Target sequences (y_train_out, y_val_out): All tokens except the first one (what the model should predict next).\n","\n","This shift-by-one setup enables the decoder-only model to learn next-token prediction autoregressively.\n","\n","_Dataset Pipelines with Performance Optimization:_\n","\n","The training and validation datasets use `prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)` to pipeline data loading and model execution, eliminating I/O bottlenecks and maximizing GPU utilization. The shuffle buffer is reduced to 5,000 to speed up shuffling operations.\n","\n","**Early Stopping Implementation:**\n","\n","_Early Stopping Callback:_\n","\n","1. Monitors validation loss with patience reduced to 3 epochs (from 5) to terminate training sooner when validation stops improving.\n","\n","2. restore_best_weights=True ensures optimal model recovery.\n","\n","3. Prevents wasted computation on Kaggle's time-limited environment.\n","\n","_Model Checkpoint:_\n","\n","1. Saves the best model to 'best_transformer_model.keras' for recovery.\n","\n","2. Ensures the best-performing version is preserved.\n","\n","_ReduceLROnPlateau Callback (New):_\n","\n","1. Automatically reduces learning rate by 50% when validation loss plateaus.\n","\n","2. Patience of 2 epochs enables quick adaptation to training dynamics.\n","\n","3. Minimum learning rate of 1e-6 prevents the learning rate from becoming too small.\n","\n","4. Helps the model escape local minima and converge faster.\n","\n","_Model Training:_ The decoder-only model trains with all three callbacks (early stopping, checkpoint, and learning rate reduction) to optimize training efficiency. The causal self-attention mechanism ensures each position can only attend to previous positions, enabling proper autoregressive generation. Expected training time on Kaggle: **4-5 hours** with 27K samples and 50 epochs (will likely stop earlier with early stopping).\n","\n","**Model Evaluation:**\n","\n","_Test Set Evaluation:_ The model is evaluated on the test set with prefetched batches for fast evaluation, providing accuracy and loss metrics.\n","\n","**Plotting Accuracy and Loss:**\n","\n","_Visualization:_ Training and validation curves show:\n","- Left subplot: Accuracy evolution showing learning progress.\n","- Right subplot: Loss evolution demonstrating optimization and convergence.\n","\n","These plots validate that early stopping and learning rate reduction are working effectively.\n","\n","**Summary of Improvements:**\n","- **Dataset:** 27K samples (9K per language) - maximum feasible for best learning\n","- **Vocabulary:** 15K words per language - **50% increase to reduce `<OOV>` issues**\n","- **Sequence Length:** 30 tokens for optimal context vs. speed balance\n","- **Architecture:** Decoder-only with 4 layers and causal self-attention (~6.2M parameters)\n","- **Embedding Dimension:** 128 for efficient representation learning\n","- **Epochs:** 50 with early stopping (will likely stop at ~35-40)\n","- **Training Time:** Expected 4-5 hours on Kaggle for quality results"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"id":"4e722786","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-10T22:20:13.603868Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-10T22:20:13.603652Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-11T01:17:36.496154Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-11T01:17:36.495192Z"},"papermill":{"duration":10643.762339,"end_time":"2025-11-11T01:17:37.358985","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-11-10T22:20:13.596646","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["================================================================================\n","MODEL CONFIGURATION - OPTIMIZED FOR GENERATION QUALITY\n","================================================================================\n","Vocabulary Size: 15,001 (15K words + padding)\n","Dataset Size: 27,000 samples (9K per language)\n","Max Epochs: 50 (with early stopping)\n","Expected Parameters: ~6.2M (up from 4.15M due to larger vocab)\n","Expected Training Time: 4-5 hours on Kaggle\n","================================================================================\n","\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/keras/src/layers/layer.py:877: UserWarning: Layer 'positional_encoding' (of type PositionalEncoding) was passed an input with a mask attached to it.

Here's a comprehensive breakdown of each function and process:\n","\n","**1. compute_exact_match Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function calculates the exact match score between the reference (actual) continuation and the predicted (generated) continuation, measuring word-by-word accuracy.\n","\n","_Steps:_\n","\n","- Tokenizes both the reference and hypothesis texts into words.\n","\n","- Compares words position-by-position to count matches.\n","\n","- Computes the match ratio by dividing matches by the maximum length of either sequence.\n","\n","- Returns: A float value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates perfect prediction and 0 indicates no matches.\n","\n","**2. compute_bleu Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function calculates the BLEU score, a standard metric for evaluating machine-generated text by comparing n-gram overlap with reference text.\n","\n","_Steps:_\n","\n","- Converts both reference and hypothesis texts to token sequences using the language-specific tokenizer.\n","\n","- Applies smoothing (method1) to handle cases with small n-grams, preventing zero scores for partial matches.\n","\n","- Uses the sentence_bleu function to compute the score based on unigram, bigram, trigram, and 4-gram overlaps.\n","\n","- Returns: The BLEU score, which measures how similar the generated text is to the reference on multiple n-gram levels.\n","\n","**3. get_seed_and_continuation Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function extracts both a seed lyric and its actual continuation from the dataset, enabling evaluation against ground truth.\n","\n","_Steps:_\n","\n","- Filters the dataset based on the specified language to ensure language-appropriate evaluation.\n","\n","- Randomly selects a lyric entry from the filtered data.\n","\n","- Splits the lyric into seed_words (the prompt) and continuation_words (the ground truth).\n","\n","- Handles edge cases where lyrics are too short by adjusting seed and continuation lengths dynamically.\n","\n","- Returns: A tuple containing (seed_text, actual_continuation), where the seed is used for prediction and the continuation serves as the reference for evaluation.\n","\n","**4. generate_text_exact Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function generates exact next lyrics using the Transformer model, predicting what actually comes next rather than paraphrasing the input.\n","\n","_Steps:_\n","\n","- Tokenizes and pads the seed text to match the model's expected input dimensions.\n","\n","- Initializes the decoder input with the seed sequence.\n","\n","- Iteratively predicts the next token for the specified number of words:\n","  - Uses the model to predict probability distributions over the vocabulary.\n","  - Applies temperature scaling to control prediction diversity (lower temperature = more conservative, higher = more creative).\n","  - Performs greedy decoding by selecting the most probable token at each step.\n","  - Stops generation if end-of-sequence token (<eos>) or padding is encountered.\n","  - Updates the decoder input with each newly generated token for autoregressive prediction.\n","\n","- Filters out special tokens (<sos>, <eos>, <OOV>) from the final output.\n","\n","- Returns: The generated text as a string containing only the predicted continuation.\n","\n","**5. Evaluation Loop and Metric Computation:**\n","\n","The code iterates over all supported languages (en, fr, ar) and performs comprehensive evaluation:\n","\n","_For each language:_\n","\n","- Tests with multiple samples (num_samples=3) to ensure robust evaluation across different contexts.\n","\n","- For each sample:\n","  - Retrieves a seed text and its actual continuation from the dataset using get_seed_and_continuation.\n","  - Displays the seed and actual continuation for transparency.\n","  - Generates predicted lyrics using generate_text_exact with temperature-controlled sampling.\n","  - Computes both exact match score and BLEU score to evaluate prediction quality from different perspectives.\n","  - Displays individual scores for each sample, allowing inspection of performance variation.\n","\n","- Aggregates scores across all samples and computes average metrics:\n","  - Average Exact Match: Indicates how many words were predicted correctly on average.\n","  - Average BLEU Score: Measures overall n-gram overlap quality across samples.\n","\n","_Outputs:_\n","\n","- For each sample: seed text, actual continuation, predicted continuation, exact match score, and BLEU score.\n","\n","- For each language: average exact match score and average BLEU score, providing a summary of the model's prediction accuracy.\n","\n","- This comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the model's ability to predict exact lyric continuations rather than paraphrase, with quantitative metrics validating performance across multiple languages and contexts.\n","\n","**Key Improvements Over Previous Approach:**\n","\n","- **Exact Prediction vs. Paraphrasing:** The model now predicts what comes next in the actual lyrics, not a rephrase of the input.\n","\n","- **Ground Truth Evaluation:** Uses actual continuations from the dataset as references, enabling objective quality assessment.\n","\n","- **Dual Metrics:** Combines exact match (word-level accuracy) with BLEU score (n-gram similarity) for comprehensive evaluation.\n","\n","- **Temperature Control:** Allows tuning between conservative (more accurate) and creative (more diverse) predictions.\n","\n","- **Multi-Sample Testing:** Averages across multiple samples per language to ensure reliable performance estimates."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"id":"6a01516d","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-11T01:18:11.402128Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-11T01:18:11.401802Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-11T01:18:17.215502Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-11T01:18:17.214537Z"},"papermill":{"duration":11.519794,"end_time":"2025-11-11T01:18:17.217457","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-11-11T01:18:05.697663","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["================================================================================\n","LYRIC PREDICTION EVALUATION (Exact Match) -

Interactive Lyric Prediction:**\n","\n","This section provides an interactive interface for generating lyric predictions using custom seed text. The predict_next_lyrics function serves as a user-friendly wrapper around the generation model, making it easy to experiment with different inputs and languages.\n","\n","**predict_next_lyrics Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function allows users to input their own seed lyrics and generate predictions in any supported language, with control over generation parameters.\n","\n","_Parameters:_\n","\n","1. **seed_text (str):** The starting lyrics or prompt text that the model will use as context for prediction.\n","\n","2. **language (str):** Language code specifying which language model to use ('en' for English, 'fr' for French, 'ar' for Arabic).\n","\n","3. **num_words (int):** The number of words to predict following the seed text, allowing control over generation length.\n","\n","4. **temperature (float):** Controls prediction randomness:\n","   - Lower values (e.g., 0.3-0.5): More conservative, predictable outputs that closely follow training patterns (recommended).\n","   - Higher values (e.g., 0.6-0.8): More creative, diverse outputs with increased variability.\n","   - Default (0.5): Conservative and coherent predictions.\n","\n","_Processing Steps:_\n","\n","1. **Language Validation:** Checks if the requested language is supported and provides helpful feedback if not.\n","\n","2. **Text Cleaning:** Applies language-specific cleaning rules to the seed text:\n","   - English: Removes special characters, converts to lowercase.\n","   - French: Preserves accented characters (À-ÿ), converts to lowercase.\n","   - Arabic: Preserves Arabic Unicode characters (\\u0600-\\u06FF), maintains original case.\n","\n","3. **Whitespace Normalization:** Removes extra spaces to ensure clean input formatting.\n","\n","4. **Generation:** Calls generate_text_exact with the cleaned seed and specified parameters.\n","\n","5. **Output Display:** Shows the seed, language, prediction details, and complete generated lyrics.\n","\n","_Returns:_ The predicted continuation as a string, which can be used programmatically or simply displayed.\n","\n","**Example Demonstrations:**\n","\n","The code includes three example predictions demonstrating the function's capabilities:\n","\n","1. **English Example:** \"I want to hold your\" → predicts 8 words with temperature 0.5\n","   - Demonstrates the model's ability to continue common English lyric patterns.\n","\n","2. **French Example:** \"je suis avec toi\" (I am with you) → predicts 8 words with temperature 0.5\n","   - Shows multilingual support and French language generation.\n","\n","3. **Arabic Example:** \"أنا معك\" (I am with you) → predicts 8 words with temperature 0.5\n","   - Validates right-to-left language handling and Arabic script generation.\n","\n","**Improved Generation Quality:**\n","\n","With the optimized configuration (15K vocabulary, 27K training samples), the model should produce:\n","- **Fewer `<OOV>` tokens** (expected <5% rate vs. previous ~50%)\n","- **More coherent continuations** with proper lyric flow\n","- **Appropriate word choices** with profanity filtering\n","- **Diverse vocabulary** covering 50% more words than before\n","\n","**User Instructions:**\n","\n","After running the examples, users can call predict_next_lyrics() with their own custom seed text, choosing their preferred language and generation parameters.
