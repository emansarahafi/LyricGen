Each layer consists of multi-head attention and a feed-forward network.\n","\n","**5. Decoder Input:**\n","The dec_inputs placeholder takes the input sequence for the decoder, similar to the encoder inputs.\n","\n","**6. Decoder Embeddings:**\n","The decoder input is passed through an embedding layer (dec_embeddings), followed by positional encoding (dec_pos_encoding), which is added to the embeddings to include positional information.\n","\n","**7. Decoder Layers:**\n","The decoder output is processed through a series of Transformer decoder layers, the number of which is specified by num_decoder_layers. Each layer takes the current decoder output and the encoder output as inputs (to perform cross-attention).\n","\n","**8. Output Layer:**\n","A dense layer with a softmax activation function is used to predict the next token in the sequence, outputting probabilities across the entire vocabulary (vocab_size).\n","\n","**9.

Here's a comprehensive breakdown of each function and process:\n","\n","**1. compute_exact_match Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function calculates the exact match score between the reference (actual) continuation and the predicted (generated) continuation, measuring word-by-word accuracy.\n","\n","_Steps:_\n","\n","- Tokenizes both the reference and hypothesis texts into words.\n","\n","- Compares words position-by-position to count matches.\n","\n","- Computes the match ratio by dividing matches by the maximum length of either sequence.\n","\n","- Returns: A float value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates perfect prediction and 0 indicates no matches.\n","\n","**2. compute_bleu Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function calculates the BLEU score, a standard metric for evaluating machine-generated text by comparing n-gram overlap with reference text.\n","\n","_Steps:_\n","\n","- Converts both reference and hypothesis texts to token sequences using the language-specific tokenizer.\n","\n","- Applies smoothing (method1) to handle cases with small n-grams, preventing zero scores for partial matches.\n","\n","- Uses the sentence_bleu function to compute the score based on unigram, bigram, trigram, and 4-gram overlaps.\n","\n","- Returns: The BLEU score, which measures how similar the generated text is to the reference on multiple n-gram levels.\n","\n","**3. get_seed_and_continuation Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function extracts both a seed lyric and its actual continuation from the dataset, enabling evaluation against ground truth.\n","\n","_Steps:_\n","\n","- Filters the dataset based on the specified language to ensure language-appropriate evaluation.\n","\n","- Randomly selects a lyric entry from the filtered data.\n","\n","- Splits the lyric into seed_words (the prompt) and continuation_words (the ground truth).\n","\n","- Handles edge cases where lyrics are too short by adjusting seed and continuation lengths dynamically.\n","\n","- Returns: A tuple containing (seed_text, actual_continuation), where the seed is used for prediction and the continuation serves as the reference for evaluation.\n","\n","**4. generate_text_exact Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function generates exact next lyrics using the Transformer model, predicting what actually comes next rather than paraphrasing the input.\n","\n","_Steps:_\n","\n","- Tokenizes and pads the seed text to match the model's expected input dimensions.\n","\n","- Initializes the decoder input with the seed sequence.\n","\n","- Iteratively predicts the next token for the specified number of words:\n","  - Uses the model to predict probability distributions over the vocabulary.\n","  - Applies temperature scaling to control prediction diversity (lower temperature = more conservative, higher = more creative).\n","  - Performs greedy decoding by selecting the most probable token at each step.\n","  - Stops generation if end-of-sequence token (<eos>) or padding is encountered.\n","  - Updates the decoder input with each newly generated token for autoregressive prediction.\n","\n","- Filters out special tokens (<sos>, <eos>, <OOV>) from the final output.\n","\n","- Returns: The generated text as a string containing only the predicted continuation.\n","\n","**5. Evaluation Loop and Metric Computation:**\n","\n","The code iterates over all supported languages (en, fr, ar) and performs comprehensive evaluation:\n","\n","_For each language:_\n","\n","- Tests with multiple samples (num_samples=3) to ensure robust evaluation across different contexts.\n","\n","- For each sample:\n","  - Retrieves a seed text and its actual continuation from the dataset using get_seed_and_continuation.\n","  - Displays the seed and actual continuation for transparency.\n","  - Generates predicted lyrics using generate_text_exact with temperature-controlled sampling.\n","  - Computes both exact match score and BLEU score to evaluate prediction quality from different perspectives.\n","  - Displays individual scores for each sample, allowing inspection of performance variation.\n","\n","- Aggregates scores across all samples and computes average metrics:\n","  - Average Exact Match: Indicates how many words were predicted correctly on average.\n","  - Average BLEU Score: Measures overall n-gram overlap quality across samples.\n","\n","_Outputs:_\n","\n","- For each sample: seed text, actual continuation, predicted continuation, exact match score, and BLEU score.\n","\n","- For each language: average exact match score and average BLEU score, providing a summary of the model's prediction accuracy.\n","\n","- This comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the model's ability to predict exact lyric continuations rather than paraphrase, with quantitative metrics validating performance across multiple languages and contexts.\n","\n","**Key Improvements Over Previous Approach:**\n","\n","- **Exact Prediction vs. Paraphrasing:** The model now predicts what comes next in the actual lyrics, not a rephrase of the input.\n","\n","- **Ground Truth Evaluation:** Uses actual continuations from the dataset as references, enabling objective quality assessment.\n","\n","- **Dual Metrics:** Combines exact match (word-level accuracy) with BLEU score (n-gram similarity) for comprehensive evaluation.\n","\n","- **Temperature Control:** Allows tuning between conservative (more accurate) and creative (more diverse) predictions.\n","\n","- **Multi-Sample Testing:** Averages across multiple samples per language to ensure reliable performance estimates."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"id":"63bf94f9","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-10T18:12:07.538821Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-10T18:12:07.538473Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-10T18:12:12.52678Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-10T18:12:12.525797Z"},"papermill":{"duration":5.505491,"end_time":"2025-11-10T18:12:12.528631","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-11-10T18:12:07.02314","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["================================================================================\n","LYRIC PREDICTION EVALUATION (Exact Match)\n","================================================================================\n","\n","================================================================================\n","Language: EN\n","================================================================================\n","\n","Sample 1:\n","Seed text: once we had what they call a good thing the\n","Actual continuation: milk and honey still in your eyes we were too\n","Predicted continuation: found sorry\n","Exact Match Score: 0.0000\n","BLEU Score: 0.0000\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Sample 2:\n","Seed text: i remember the feeling of waiting backstage in the theater\n","Actual continuation: room reciting my lyrics and being submerged in the backtrack\n","Predicted continuation: room\n","Exact Match Score: 0.1000\n","BLEU Score: 0.0000\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Sample 3:\n","Seed text: verse 1 swamburger i say the same things in life\n","Actual continuation: that i say in my songs yet ones considered right\n","Predicted continuation: that <OOV>\n","Exact Match Score: 0.1000\n","BLEU Score: 0.0027\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","EN -
