The `predict_next_lyrics` function serves as a user-friendly wrapper around the generation model, making it easy to experiment with different inputs and languages.\n","\n","**`predict_next_lyrics` Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function allows users to input their own seed lyrics and generate predictions in any supported language, with control over generation parameters.\n","\n","_Parameters:_\n","\n","1. **seed_text (str):** The starting lyrics or prompt text that the model will use as context for prediction.\n","2. **language (str):** Language code specifying which language model to use ('en' for English, 'fr' for French, 'ar' for Arabic).\n","3. **num_words (int):** The number of words to predict following the seed text.\n","4. **beam_width (int):** Controls the number of candidate sequences to explore at each step. A larger beam width (e.g., 5 or 10) can produce more coherent results at the cost of computation time.\n","\n","_Processing Steps:_\n","\n","1. **Language Validation:** Checks if the requested language is supported.\n","2. **Text Cleaning:** Applies language-specific cleaning rules to the seed text.\n","3. **Generation:** Calls `generate_text_beam_search` to predict the next words.\n","4. **Output Display:** Shows the seed, language, prediction details, and complete generated lyrics.\n","\n","_Returns:_ The predicted continuation as a string.\n","\n","**Example Demonstrations:**\n","\n","The code includes three example predictions demonstrating the function's capabilities in English, French, and Arabic, all using beam search to generate continuations.\n","\n","**Generation Quality:**\n","\n","With the optimized configuration and beam search, the model produces:\n","- **Coherent continuations** with improved lyric flow.\n","- **Diverse vocabulary** covering 15,000 words per language.\n","- **Robust generation** with filtering and OOV handling.\n","\n","**User Instructions:**\n","\n","After running the examples, users can call `predict_next_lyrics()` with their own custom seed text, choosing their preferred language and beam width. This interactive approach makes the model accessible for creative experimentation and practical lyric generation tasks."]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"nvidiaTeslaT4","dataSources":[{"datasetId":2805070,"sourceId":4840139,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":30787,"isGpuEnabled":true,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.14"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":1726.790518,"end_time":"2025-11-13T21:36:35.664401","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2025-11-13T21:07:48.873883","version":"2.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
