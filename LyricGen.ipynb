Interactive Lyric Prediction:**\n","\n","This section provides an interactive interface for generating lyric predictions using custom seed text. The `predict_next_lyrics` function serves as a user-friendly wrapper around the generation model, making it easy to experiment with different inputs, languages, and generation strategies.\n","\n","**`predict_next_lyrics` Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function allows users to input their own seed lyrics and generate predictions in any supported language, with control over generation parameters.\n","\n","_Parameters:_\n","\n","1. **seed_text (str):** The starting lyrics or prompt text that the model will use as context for prediction.\n","2. **language (str):** Language code specifying which language model to use ('en' for English, 'fr' for French, 'ar' for Arabic).\n","3. **num_words (int):** The number of words to predict following the seed text.\n","4. **strategy (str):** The generation strategy to use—either `'beam_search'` for coherence or `'nucleus_sampling'` for creativity.\n","5. **beam_width (int):** Controls the number of candidate sequences to explore at each step in beam search.\n","6. **temperature (float):** Adjusts the randomness of predictions in nucleus sampling. Higher values increase diversity.\n","7. **top_p (float):** Sets the cumulative probability threshold for nucleus sampling, controlling the trade-off between diversity and coherence.\n","\n","_Processing Steps:_\n","\n","1. **Language Validation:** Checks if the requested language is supported.\n","2. **Text Cleaning:** Applies language-specific cleaning rules to the seed text.\n","3. **Generation:** Calls `generate_text` to predict the next words using the chosen strategy.\n","4. **Output Display:** Shows the seed, language, prediction details, and complete generated lyrics.\n","\n","_Returns:_ The predicted continuation as a string.\n","\n","**Example Demonstrations:**\n","\n","The code includes six example predictions demonstrating the function's capabilities in English, French, and Arabic, using both beam search and nucleus sampling to generate continuations.\n","\n","**Generation Quality:**\n","\n","With the enhanced configuration and multiple generation strategies, the model produces:\n","- **Coherent continuations** with improved lyric flow (beam search).\n","- **Creative and diverse outputs** with controlled randomness (nucleus sampling).\n","- **Robust generation** with filtering and OOV handling.\n","\n","**User Instructions:**\n","\n","After running the examples, users can call `predict_next_lyrics()` with their own custom seed text, choosing their preferred language and generation strategy.
