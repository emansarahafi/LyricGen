The hyperparameters have been carefully optimized to balance model quality with overfitting prevention while remaining feasible on Kaggle's computational environment. Here's a comprehensive breakdown:\n","\n","**Hyperparameters:**\n","\n","1. _Embedding dimension (embed_dim):_ Set to **256** to provide rich, expressive word representations that capture nuanced semantic meanings across languages.\n","\n","2. _Number of attention heads (num_heads):_ Set to **8** for comprehensive multi-head attention, enabling the model to learn diverse attention patterns and relationships between words.\n","\n","3. _Feedforward dimension (ff_dim):_ Set to **1024** to provide substantial capacity in the feed-forward layers, allowing the model to learn complex patterns in lyric structures.\n","\n","4. _Number of decoder layers (num_layers):_ Set to **4 layers** for the decoder-only architecture. This configuration provides sufficient depth for learning complex patterns while preventing overfitting given the dataset size of 9,000 samples per language.\n","\n","5. _Dropout rate (dropout_rate):_ Set to **0.35** to prevent overfitting while maintaining model capacity. Dropout is also applied to attention layers for additional regularization.\n","\n","6. _Vocabulary size (vocab_size):_ Set to **15,001** (15,000 + 1 for padding token at index 0) for comprehensive word coverage across all three languages.\n","\n","7. _Maximum sequence length (max_len):_ Set to **50 tokens**, providing a suitable context window for learning lyric dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency.\n","\n","8. _Batch size (batch_size):_ Set to **64** to accommodate the model architecture while maintaining training efficiency.\n","\n","9. _Epochs (epochs):_ Set to **100** with early stopping, allowing sufficient training time for the architecture to converge.\n","\n","10. _Learning rate (learning_rate):_ Set to **1e-4** with gradient clipping (clipnorm=1.0) for stable training and prevention of exploding gradients.\n","\n","**Model Building and Compilation:**\n","\n","1. _Build Decoder-Only Transformer:_ Calls the build_decoder_only_transformer function to create a GPT-style autoregressive model with 4 decoder layers, causal self-attention masking, and attention dropout.\n","\n","2. _Compile Model:_ Uses Adam optimizer with gradient clipping, sparse categorical cross-entropy loss, and accuracy metric for next-token prediction.\n","\n","3. _Summary:_ Displays the complete model architecture with approximately **10-12M trainable parameters**.\n","\n","**Preparing the Data:**\n","\n","_Autoregressive Sequence Setup:_\n","\n","1. Input sequences (train_input, val_input): All tokens except the last one (used as context for prediction).\n","\n","2. Target sequences (train_target, val_target): All tokens except the first one (what the model should predict next).\n","\n","This shift-by-one approach creates proper autoregressive training pairs where the model learns to predict each next token given all previous tokens in the sequence. The generation function is aligned with this training paradigm.\n","\n","_Dataset Pipelines with Performance Optimization:_\n","\n","The training and validation datasets use `prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)` to pipeline data loading and model execution, eliminating I/O bottlenecks and maximizing GPU utilization. The shuffle buffer is set to 5,000 for effective randomization during training.\n","\n","**Training Callbacks:**\n","\n","_Early Stopping Callback:_\n","\n","1. Monitors validation loss with patience of **10 epochs** to allow sufficient convergence time before stopping.\n","\n","2. restore_best_weights=True ensures optimal model recovery from the best epoch.\n","\n","3. Prevents unnecessary computation when the model stops improving.\n","\n","_Model Checkpoint:_\n","\n","1. Saves the best model to 'best_transformer_model.keras' based on validation loss.\n","\n","2. Ensures the best-performing version is preserved throughout training.\n","\n","_ReduceLROnPlateau Callback:_\n","\n","1. Automatically reduces learning rate by 50% when validation loss plateaus.\n","\n","2. Patience of **5 epochs** enables careful adaptation to training dynamics.\n","\n","3. Minimum learning rate of 1e-7 prevents the learning rate from becoming ineffectively small.\n","\n","4. Helps the model escape local minima and achieve better convergence.\n","\n","_Model Training:_ The decoder-only model trains with all three callbacks to optimize training efficiency and model quality. The causal self-attention mechanism ensures each position can only attend to previous positions, enabling proper autoregressive next-word generation.\n","\n","**Model Evaluation:**\n","\n","_Test Set Evaluation:_ The model is evaluated on the held-out test set with prefetched batches for fast evaluation, providing final accuracy and loss metrics that indicate real-world performance.\n","\n","**Plotting Accuracy and Loss:**\n","\n","_Visualization:_ Training and validation curves provide insights into the learning process:\n","- Accuracy plot: Shows how prediction accuracy improves over epochs for both training and validation sets.\n","- Loss plot: Demonstrates optimization progress and convergence behavior, helping identify overfitting or underfitting.\n","\n","These plots validate the effectiveness of the training process and confirm proper model learning.\n","\n","**Model Configuration Summary:**\n","- **Dataset:** 27K samples (9K per language) for comprehensive multilingual learning\n","- **Vocabulary:** 15K words per language for extensive word coverage\n","- **Sequence Length:** 50 tokens for sufficient context\n","- **Architecture:** Decoder-only with 4 layers and causal self-attention (~10-12M parameters)\n","- **Embedding Dimension:** 256 for rich semantic representations\n","- **Attention Heads:** 8 for diverse attention patterns with attention dropout\n","- **Feed-forward Dimension:** 1024 for substantial learning capacity\n","- **Batch Size:** 64 to accommodate the architecture\n","- **Learning Rate:** 1e-4 with gradient clipping for stable training\n","- **Dropout Rate:** 0.35 for regularization\n","- **Epochs:** 100 with early stopping for optimal convergence"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"id":"55601734","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-12-05T15:50:50.072455Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-12-05T15:50:50.071859Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-12-05T16:18:20.267341Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-12-05T16:18:20.266485Z"},"papermill":{"duration":1650.205259,"end_time":"2025-12-05T16:18:20.26999","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-12-05T15:50:50.064731","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["================================================================================\n","IMPROVED MODEL CONFIGURATION\n","================================================================================\n","Vocabulary Size: 15,001 (15K words + padding at index 0)\n","Sequence Length: 50 tokens (increased for better context)\n","Embedding Dimension: 256 (increased for better representations)\n","Attention Heads: 8 (more attention patterns)\n","Feed-forward Dimension: 1024 (more learning capacity)\n","Decoder Layers: 4 (reduced to prevent overfitting)\n","Dropout Rate: 0.35 (increased for better regularization)\n","Batch Size: 64 (accommodates larger model)\n","Learning Rate: 0.0001 (more stable training)\n","Max Epochs: 100 (with early stopping)\n","Expected Parameters: ~10-12M (balanced capacity)\n","================================================================================\n","\n"]},{"data":{"text/html":["<pre style=\"white-space:pre;overflow-x:auto;line-height:normal;font-family:Menlo,'DejaVu Sans Mono',consolas,'Courier New',monospace\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Model: \"DecoderOnly_Transformer\"</span>\n","</pre>\n"],"text/plain":["\u001b[1mModel: \"DecoderOnly_Transformer\"\u001b[0m\n"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"text/html":["<pre style=\"white-space:pre;overflow-x:auto;line-height:normal;font-family:Menlo,'DejaVu Sans Mono',consolas,'Courier New',monospace\">┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓\n","┃<span style=\"font-weight: bold\"> Layer (type)        </span>┃<span style=\"font-weight: bold\"> Output Shape      </span>┃<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">    Param # </span>┃<span style=\"font-weight: bold\"> Connected to      </span>┃\n","┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┩\n","│ Input (<span style=\"color: #0087ff;

The evaluation employs multiple metrics to assess prediction quality comprehensively.\n","\n","**1. compute_exact_match Function:**\n","\n","Calculates exact match accuracy by comparing the reference continuation with the generated text on a word-by-word basis. This metric measures how many words were predicted correctly in the exact positions, returning a score between 0 and 1. While exact match scores tend to be lower for creative text generation (typically 10-30% for good models), they provide insight into the model's precision.\n","\n","**2. compute_bleu Function:**\n","\n","Computes the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score, a standard metric in natural language generation that evaluates n-gram overlap between generated and reference text. The function uses smoothing to handle edge cases and returns scores typically ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 for lyric generation tasks. BLEU scores measure overall similarity while accounting for word order and phrase structure.\n","\n","**3. get_seed_and_continuation Function:**\n","\n","Extracts seed text and its actual continuation from the dataset for evaluation. This function randomly selects a lyric from the specified language, splits it into a seed portion (first 10 words) and continuation portion (next 10 words), and handles edge cases where lyrics are shorter than expected. This provides ground truth for evaluating model predictions.\n","\n","**4. generate_text_exact Function:**\n","\n","The core generation function that produces lyric continuations using the trained Transformer model. Key features include:\n","\n","- **Training Alignment:** Prepends `<sos>` token to seed text, ensuring the input format matches training data exactly\n","- **Input Preparation:** Pads sequences to `max_len-1` (49 tokens) to match the model's expected input dimensions\n","- **Autoregressive Prediction:** Iteratively predicts one token at a time, appending each prediction to the sequence\n","- **Temperature Sampling:** Controls randomness via temperature parameter (0.7 default for balanced output)\n","- **Top-k Filtering:** Restricts sampling to the top 50 most probable tokens, improving generation quality\n","- **Probability Normalization:** Ensures probability distributions sum to 1.0 for valid sampling\n","- **Special Token Handling:** Stops on `<eos>`, skips `<sos>` during generation, and manages out-of-vocabulary tokens\n","- **Quality Controls:** Limits consecutive OOV tokens to 3 and respects maximum sequence length\n","\n","**5. Evaluation Process:**\n","\n","The evaluation loop tests the model across all three supported languages with multiple samples per language:\n","\n","- **Per-Sample Evaluation:** For each test case, the system retrieves seed text, generates predictions, and computes both exact match and BLEU scores\n","- **Aggregate Metrics:** Averages scores across samples to provide language-level performance summaries\n","- **Transparency:** Displays seed text, actual continuation, and generated continuation for each sample, enabling qualitative assessment\n","\n","**Understanding Evaluation Metrics:**\n","\n","For creative text generation like lyrics, typical performance ranges are:\n","- **Exact Match:** 10-30% indicates good performance (exact word prediction is inherently difficult)\n","- **BLEU Score:** 0.1-0.4 is reasonable for lyric generation tasks\n","- **Higher scores** might indicate memorization rather than genuine understanding\n","\n","The model should be evaluated holistically on:\n","- **Coherence:** Do generated lyrics flow logically?\n","- **Relevance:** Do they relate meaningfully to the seed text?\n","- **Fluency:** Are they grammatically correct and natural-sounding?\n","- **Creativity:** Do they show variety without being nonsensical?\n","\n","This comprehensive evaluation framework validates the model's ability to generate contextually appropriate lyric continuations across multiple languages."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"id":"ac779bc0","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-12-05T16:18:23.439683Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-12-05T16:18:23.439303Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-12-05T16:18:31.680837Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-12-05T16:18:31.67987Z"},"papermill":{"duration":8.756833,"end_time":"2025-12-05T16:18:31.682421","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-12-05T16:18:22.925588","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["================================================================================\n","LYRIC PREDICTION EVALUATION (Exact Match)\n","================================================================================\n","\n","================================================================================\n","Language: EN\n","================================================================================\n","\n","Sample 1:\n","Seed text: hes home and for the first time ever he walked\n","Actual continuation: alone in a world hed once known hes home just\n","Predicted continuation: and it seems for me to me to be a\n","Exact Match Score: 0.0000\n","BLEU Score: 0.0211\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Sample 2:\n","Seed text: uh yeah yeah yeah ayy yeah lets go ayy yeah\n","Actual continuation: move the chains im about to make a play move\n","Predicted continuation: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\n","Exact Match Score: 0.0000\n","BLEU Score: 0.0000\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Sample 3:\n","Seed text: ive been down and out before its nothing new to\n","Actual continuation: me ive got a big fire burning deep inside that\n","Predicted continuation: the same day i guess i just see the things\n","Exact Match Score: 0.0000\n","BLEU Score: 0.0000\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","EN -
