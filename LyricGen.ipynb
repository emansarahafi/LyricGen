The hyperparameters have been carefully optimized to balance model quality with overfitting prevention while remaining feasible on Kaggle's computational environment. Here's a comprehensive breakdown:\n","\n","**Hyperparameters:**\n","\n","1. _Embedding dimension (embed_dim):_ Set to **256** to provide rich, expressive word representations that capture nuanced semantic meanings across languages.\n","\n","2. _Number of attention heads (num_heads):_ Set to **8** for comprehensive multi-head attention, enabling the model to learn diverse attention patterns and relationships between words.\n","\n","3. _Feedforward dimension (ff_dim):_ Set to **1024** to provide substantial capacity in the feed-forward layers, allowing the model to learn complex patterns in lyric structures.\n","\n","4. _Number of decoder layers (num_layers):_ Set to **4 layers** for the decoder-only architecture. This configuration provides sufficient depth for learning complex patterns while preventing overfitting given the dataset size of 9,000 samples per language.\n","\n","5. _Dropout rate (dropout_rate):_ Set to **0.35** to prevent overfitting while maintaining model capacity. Dropout is also applied to attention layers for additional regularization.\n","\n","6. _Vocabulary size (vocab_size):_ Set to **15,001** (15,000 + 1 for padding token at index 0) for comprehensive word coverage across all three languages.\n","\n","7. _Maximum sequence length (max_len):_ Set to **50 tokens**, providing a suitable context window for learning lyric dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency.\n","\n","8. _Batch size (batch_size):_ Set to **64** to accommodate the model architecture while maintaining training efficiency.\n","\n","9. _Epochs (epochs):_ Set to **100** with early stopping, allowing sufficient training time for the architecture to converge.\n","\n","10. _Learning rate (learning_rate):_ Set to **1e-4** with gradient clipping (clipnorm=1.0) for stable training and prevention of exploding gradients.\n","\n","**Model Building and Compilation:**\n","\n","1. _Build Decoder-Only Transformer:_ Calls the build_decoder_only_transformer function to create a GPT-style autoregressive model with 4 decoder layers, causal self-attention masking, and attention dropout.\n","\n","2. _Compile Model:_ Uses Adam optimizer with gradient clipping, sparse categorical cross-entropy loss, and accuracy metric for next-token prediction.\n","\n","3. _Summary:_ Displays the complete model architecture with approximately **10-12M trainable parameters**.\n","\n","**Preparing the Data:**\n","\n","_Autoregressive Sequence Setup:_\n","\n","1. Input sequences (train_input, val_input): All tokens except the last one (used as context for prediction).\n","\n","2. Target sequences (train_target, val_target): All tokens except the first one (what the model should predict next).\n","\n","This shift-by-one approach creates proper autoregressive training pairs where the model learns to predict each next token given all previous tokens in the sequence. The generation function is aligned with this training paradigm.\n","\n","_Dataset Pipelines with Performance Optimization:_\n","\n","The training and validation datasets use `prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)` to pipeline data loading and model execution, eliminating I/O bottlenecks and maximizing GPU utilization. The shuffle buffer is set to 5,000 for effective randomization during training.\n","\n","**Training Callbacks:**\n","\n","_Early Stopping Callback:_\n","\n","1. Monitors validation loss with patience of **10 epochs** to allow sufficient convergence time before stopping.\n","\n","2. restore_best_weights=True ensures optimal model recovery from the best epoch.\n","\n","3. Prevents unnecessary computation when the model stops improving.\n","\n","_Model Checkpoint:_\n","\n","1. Saves the best model to 'best_transformer_model.keras' based on validation loss.\n","\n","2. Ensures the best-performing version is preserved throughout training.\n","\n","_ReduceLROnPlateau Callback:_\n","\n","1. Automatically reduces learning rate by 50% when validation loss plateaus.\n","\n","2. Patience of **5 epochs** enables careful adaptation to training dynamics.\n","\n","3. Minimum learning rate of 1e-7 prevents the learning rate from becoming ineffectively small.\n","\n","4. Helps the model escape local minima and achieve better convergence.\n","\n","_Model Training:_ The decoder-only model trains with all three callbacks to optimize training efficiency and model quality. The causal self-attention mechanism ensures each position can only attend to previous positions, enabling proper autoregressive next-word generation.\n","\n","**Model Evaluation:**\n","\n","_Test Set Evaluation:_ The model is evaluated on the held-out test set with prefetched batches for fast evaluation, providing final accuracy and loss metrics that indicate real-world performance.\n","\n","**Plotting Accuracy and Loss:**\n","\n","_Visualization:_ Training and validation curves provide insights into the learning process:\n","- Accuracy plot: Shows how prediction accuracy improves over epochs for both training and validation sets.\n","- Loss plot: Demonstrates optimization progress and convergence behavior, helping identify overfitting or underfitting.\n","\n","These plots validate the effectiveness of the training process and confirm proper model learning.\n","\n","**Model Configuration Summary:**\n","- **Dataset:** 27K samples (9K per language) for comprehensive multilingual learning\n","- **Vocabulary:** 15K words per language for extensive word coverage\n","- **Sequence Length:** 50 tokens for sufficient context\n","- **Architecture:** Decoder-only with 4 layers and causal self-attention (~10-12M parameters)\n","- **Embedding Dimension:** 256 for rich semantic representations\n","- **Attention Heads:** 8 for diverse attention patterns with attention dropout\n","- **Feed-forward Dimension:** 1024 for substantial learning capacity\n","- **Batch Size:** 64 to accommodate the architecture\n","- **Learning Rate:** 1e-4 with gradient clipping for stable training\n","- **Dropout Rate:** 0.35 for regularization\n","- **Epochs:** 100 with early stopping for optimal convergence"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"id":"d1d575a8","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-21T14:51:44.359463Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-21T14:51:44.359174Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-21T15:19:05.856891Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-21T15:19:05.856067Z"},"papermill":{"duration":1641.507373,"end_time":"2025-11-21T15:19:05.859123","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-11-21T14:51:44.35175","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["================================================================================\n","IMPROVED MODEL CONFIGURATION\n","================================================================================\n","Vocabulary Size: 15,001 (15K words + padding at index 0)\n","Sequence Length: 50 tokens (increased for better context)\n","Embedding Dimension: 256 (increased for better representations)\n","Attention Heads: 8 (more attention patterns)\n","Feed-forward Dimension: 1024 (more learning capacity)\n","Decoder Layers: 4 (reduced to prevent overfitting)\n","Dropout Rate: 0.35 (increased for better regularization)\n","Batch Size: 64 (accommodates larger model)\n","Learning Rate: 0.0001 (more stable training)\n","Max Epochs: 100 (with early stopping)\n","Expected Parameters: ~10-12M (balanced capacity)\n","================================================================================\n","\n"]},{"data":{"text/html":["<pre style=\"white-space:pre;overflow-x:auto;line-height:normal;font-family:Menlo,'DejaVu Sans Mono',consolas,'Courier New',monospace\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Model: \"DecoderOnly_Transformer\"</span>\n","</pre>\n"],"text/plain":["\u001b[1mModel: \"DecoderOnly_Transformer\"\u001b[0m\n"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"text/html":["<pre style=\"white-space:pre;overflow-x:auto;line-height:normal;font-family:Menlo,'DejaVu Sans Mono',consolas,'Courier New',monospace\">┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓\n","┃<span style=\"font-weight: bold\"> Layer (type)        </span>┃<span style=\"font-weight: bold\"> Output Shape      </span>┃<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">    Param # </span>┃<span style=\"font-weight: bold\"> Connected to      </span>┃\n","┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┩\n","│ Input (<span style=\"color: #0087ff;

Here's a comprehensive breakdown of each function and process:\n","\n","**1. compute_exact_match Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function calculates the exact match score between the reference (actual) continuation and the predicted (generated) continuation, measuring word-by-word accuracy.\n","\n","_Steps:_\n","\n","- Tokenizes both the reference and hypothesis texts into words.\n","\n","- Compares words position-by-position to count matches.\n","\n","- Computes the match ratio by dividing matches by the maximum length of either sequence.\n","\n","- Returns: A float value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates perfect prediction and 0 indicates no matches.\n","\n","**2. compute_bleu Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function calculates the BLEU score, a standard metric for evaluating machine-generated text by comparing n-gram overlap with reference text.\n","\n","_Steps:_\n","\n","- Converts both reference and hypothesis texts to token sequences using the language-specific tokenizer.\n","\n","- Applies smoothing (method1) to handle cases with small n-grams, preventing zero scores for partial matches.\n","\n","- Uses the sentence_bleu function to compute the score based on unigram, bigram, trigram, and 4-gram overlaps.\n","\n","- Includes empty string validation to prevent warnings.\n","\n","- Returns: The BLEU score, which measures how similar the generated text is to the reference on multiple n-gram levels.\n","\n","**3. get_seed_and_continuation Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function extracts both a seed lyric and its actual continuation from the dataset, enabling evaluation against ground truth.\n","\n","_Steps:_\n","\n","- Filters the dataset based on the specified language to ensure language-appropriate evaluation.\n","\n","- Randomly selects a lyric entry from the filtered data.\n","\n","- Splits the lyric into seed_words (the prompt) and continuation_words (the ground truth).\n","\n","- Handles edge cases where lyrics are too short by adjusting seed and continuation lengths dynamically.\n","\n","- Returns: A tuple containing (seed_text, actual_continuation), where the seed is used for prediction and the continuation serves as the reference for evaluation.\n","\n","**4. generate_text_exact Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function generates exact next lyrics using the Transformer model, predicting what actually comes next rather than paraphrasing the input.\n","\n","_Implementation Details:_\n","\n","- **Input preparation**: Pads to `max_len-1` to match training where input has length n-1 and target has length n.\n","- **Prediction position**: Uses `actual_seq_len - 1` to get the last position's prediction, consistent with the training approach.\n","- **Probability normalization**: After temperature scaling, ensures probabilities sum to exactly 1.0.\n","- **Padding**: Uses explicit `value=0` to match training data preparation.\n","\n","_Steps:_\n","\n","- Tokenizes and pads the seed text to match the model's expected input dimensions.\n","\n","- Initializes the decoder input with the seed sequence.\n","\n","- Iteratively predicts the next token for the specified number of words:\n","  - Pads the current sequence to exactly `max_len-1` (matching training input size).\n","  - Uses the model to predict probability distributions over the vocabulary.\n","  - Applies temperature scaling to control prediction diversity (lower temperature = more conservative, higher = more creative).\n","  - Normalizes probabilities to ensure they sum to 1.0 after temperature scaling.\n","  - Performs sampling from the probability distribution (not just greedy decoding).\n","  - Stops generation if end-of-sequence token (<eos>) or padding (0) is encountered.\n","  - Updates the decoder input with each newly generated token for autoregressive prediction.\n","  - Implements OOV (out-of-vocabulary) handling with limits to maintain generation quality.\n","\n","- Filters out special tokens (<sos>, <eos>, <OOV>) from the final output.\n","\n","- Returns: The generated text as a string containing only the predicted continuation.\n","\n","**5. Evaluation Loop and Metric Computation:**\n","\n","The code iterates over all supported languages (en, fr, ar) and performs comprehensive evaluation:\n","\n","_For each language:_\n","\n","- Tests with multiple samples (num_samples=3) to ensure robust evaluation across different contexts.\n","\n","- For each sample:\n","  - Retrieves a seed text and its actual continuation from the dataset using get_seed_and_continuation.\n","  - Displays the seed and actual continuation for transparency.\n","  - Generates predicted lyrics using generate_text_exact with temperature-controlled sampling.\n","  - Computes both exact match score and BLEU score to evaluate prediction quality from different perspectives.\n","  - Displays individual scores for each sample, allowing inspection of performance variation.\n","\n","- Aggregates scores across all samples and computes average metrics:\n","  - Average Exact Match: Indicates how many words were predicted correctly on average.\n","  - Average BLEU Score: Measures overall n-gram overlap quality across samples.\n","\n","_Outputs:_\n","\n","- For each sample: seed text, actual continuation, predicted continuation, exact match score, and BLEU score.\n","\n","- For each language: average exact match score and average BLEU score, providing a summary of the model's prediction accuracy.\n","\n","This comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the model's ability to predict exact lyric continuations with quantitative metrics validating performance across multiple languages and contexts."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"id":"9604cf9f","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-21T15:19:09.285236Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-21T15:19:09.284747Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-21T15:19:17.321457Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-21T15:19:17.320438Z"},"papermill":{"duration":8.645737,"end_time":"2025-11-21T15:19:17.323184","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-11-21T15:19:08.677447","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["================================================================================\n","LYRIC PREDICTION EVALUATION (Exact Match)\n","================================================================================\n","\n","================================================================================\n","Language: EN\n","================================================================================\n","\n","Sample 1:\n","Seed text: im the singh im the king im the king im\n","Actual continuation: the singh im the singh im the king im the\n","Predicted continuation: this be said ive got a thatll and im too\n","Exact Match Score: 0.1000\n","BLEU Score: 0.0211\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Sample 2:\n","Seed text: on a chilly evening in the act of keeping warm\n","Actual continuation: intuition told the prince of some impending harm and so\n","Predicted continuation: the\n","Exact Match Score: 0.0000\n","BLEU Score: 0.0000\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Sample 3:\n","Seed text: driving down the road on an icy storming night night\n","Actual continuation: night doing what we can to surive this horrid drive\n","Predicted continuation: down flow at both gotti on falling on\n","Exact Match Score: 0.0000\n","BLEU Score: 0.0000\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","EN -
