The hyperparameters have been carefully optimized to maximize model capacity while remaining feasible on Kaggle's computational environment. Here's a comprehensive breakdown:\n","\n","**Hyperparameters (Optimized for High-Quality Predictions):**\n","\n","1. _Embedding dimension (embed_dim):_ Set to **256** to provide rich, expressive word representations that capture nuanced semantic meanings across languages.\n","\n","2. _Number of attention heads (num_heads):_ Set to **8** for comprehensive multi-head attention, enabling the model to learn diverse attention patterns and relationships between words.\n","\n","3. _Feedforward dimension (ff_dim):_ Set to **1024** to provide substantial capacity in the feed-forward layers, allowing the model to learn complex patterns in lyric structures.\n","\n","4. _Number of decoder layers (num_layers):_ Set to **6** layers for the decoder-only architecture, providing deep learning capacity to capture intricate dependencies in lyric sequences.\n","\n","5. _Dropout rate (dropout_rate):_ Set to **0.2** to prevent overfitting while maintaining model capacity, ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen lyrics.\n","\n","6. _Vocabulary size (vocab_size):_ Set to **15,001** (15,000 + 1 for padding token) for comprehensive word coverage across all three languages.\n","\n","7. _Maximum sequence length (max_len):_ Set to 30 tokens, balancing context window with computational efficiency.\n","\n","8. _Batch size (batch_size):_ Set to **64** to accommodate the larger model architecture while maintaining training efficiency.\n","\n","9. _Epochs (epochs):_ Set to **100** with early stopping, allowing sufficient training time for the deeper architecture to converge.\n","\n","10. _Learning rate (learning_rate):_ Set to **1e-4** with gradient clipping (clipnorm=1.0) for stable training and prevention of exploding gradients in the deeper network.\n","\n","**Model Building and Compilation:**\n","\n","1. _Build Decoder-Only Transformer:_ Calls the build_decoder_only_transformer function to create a GPT-style autoregressive model with 6 decoder layers and causal self-attention masking.\n","\n","2. _Compile Model:_ Uses Adam optimizer with gradient clipping, sparse categorical cross-entropy loss, and accuracy metric for next-token prediction.\n","\n","3. _Summary:_ Displays the complete model architecture with approximately **15-20M trainable parameters**, providing significantly more learning capacity than smaller architectures.\n","\n","**Preparing the Data:**\n","\n","_Autoregressive Sequence Setup:_\n","\n","1. Input sequences (train_input, val_input): All tokens except the last one (used as context for prediction).\n","\n","2. Target sequences (train_target, val_target): All tokens except the first one (what the model should predict next).\n","\n","This shift-by-one approach creates proper autoregressive training pairs where the model learns to predict each next token given all previous tokens in the sequence.\n","\n","_Dataset Pipelines with Performance Optimization:_\n","\n","The training and validation datasets use `prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)` to pipeline data loading and model execution, eliminating I/O bottlenecks and maximizing GPU utilization. The shuffle buffer is set to 5,000 for effective randomization during training.\n","\n","**Training Callbacks:**\n","\n","_Early Stopping Callback:_\n","\n","1. Monitors validation loss with patience of **10 epochs** (increased for the larger model) to allow sufficient convergence time before stopping.\n","\n","2. restore_best_weights=True ensures optimal model recovery from the best epoch.\n","\n","3. Prevents unnecessary computation when the model stops improving.\n","\n","_Model Checkpoint:_\n","\n","1. Saves the best model to 'best_transformer_model.keras' based on validation loss.\n","\n","2. Ensures the best-performing version is preserved throughout training.\n","\n","_ReduceLROnPlateau Callback:_\n","\n","1. Automatically reduces learning rate by 50% when validation loss plateaus.\n","\n","2. Patience of **5 epochs** (increased for stability) enables careful adaptation to training dynamics.\n","\n","3. Minimum learning rate of 1e-7 prevents the learning rate from becoming ineffectively small.\n","\n","4. Helps the model escape local minima and achieve better convergence.\n","\n","_Model Training:_ The decoder-only model trains with all three callbacks to optimize training efficiency and model quality. The causal self-attention mechanism ensures each position can only attend to previous positions, enabling proper autoregressive next-word generation.\n","\n","**Model Evaluation:**\n","\n","_Test Set Evaluation:_ The model is evaluated on the held-out test set with prefetched batches for fast evaluation, providing final accuracy and loss metrics that indicate real-world performance.\n","\n","**Plotting Accuracy and Loss:**\n","\n","_Visualization:_ Training and validation curves provide insights into the learning process:\n","- Accuracy plot: Shows how prediction accuracy improves over epochs for both training and validation sets.\n","- Loss plot: Demonstrates optimization progress and convergence behavior, helping identify overfitting or underfitting.\n","\n","These plots validate the effectiveness of the training process and confirm proper model learning.\n","\n","**Model Configuration Summary:**\n","- **Dataset:** 27K samples (9K per language) for comprehensive multilingual learning\n","- **Vocabulary:** 15K words per language for extensive word coverage\n","- **Sequence Length:** 30 tokens for optimal context vs. speed balance\n","- **Architecture:** Decoder-only with 6 layers and causal self-attention (~15-20M parameters)\n","- **Embedding Dimension:** 256 for rich semantic representations\n","- **Attention Heads:** 8 for diverse attention patterns\n","- **Feed-forward Dimension:** 1024 for substantial learning capacity\n","\n","- **Batch Size:** 64 to accommodate larger architecture- **Learning Rate:** 1e-4 with gradient clipping for stable training\n","- **Epochs:** 100 with early stopping for optimal convergence"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"id":"da6d712b","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-15T20:18:32.566041Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-15T20:18:32.565722Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-15T20:38:48.47248Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-15T20:38:48.471711Z"},"papermill":{"duration":1215.916413,"end_time":"2025-11-15T20:38:48.474416","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-11-15T20:18:32.558003","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["================================================================================\n","IMPROVED
