The hyperparameters have been carefully optimized for Kaggle's computational environment to complete training in 1-2 hours. Here's a comprehensive breakdown:\n","\n","**Hyperparameters (Optimized for Decoder-Only Architecture):**\n","\n","1. _Embedding dimension (embed_dim):_ Set to 128 to balance expressiveness with computational efficiency.\n","\n","2. _Number of attention heads (num_heads):_ Set to 4 for effective multi-head attention without excessive computation.\n","\n","3. _Feedforward dimension (ff_dim):_ Set to 512 to provide sufficient capacity in the feed-forward layers.\n","\n","4. _Number of decoder layers (num_layers):_ Set to 4 layers for the decoder-only architecture, providing good depth for learning lyric patterns.\n","\n","5. _Dropout rate (dropout_rate):_ Set to 0.1 to prevent overfitting while maintaining model capacity.\n","\n","6. _Vocabulary size (vocab_size):_ Set to 10,001 (10,000 + 1 for padding token).\n","\n","7. _Maximum sequence length (max_len):_ Set to 30 tokens, balancing context window with computational efficiency.\n","\n","8. _Batch size (batch_size):_ Set to 128 for optimal GPU utilization and training speed.\n","\n","9. _Epochs (epochs):_ Set to 40 to allow sufficient training time with the larger 24K sample dataset.\n","\n","10. _Learning rate (learning_rate):_ Set to 5e-4 for effective convergence with adaptive learning rate scheduling.\n","\n","**Model Building and Compilation:**\n","\n","1. _Build Decoder-Only Transformer:_ Calls the build_decoder_only_transformer function to create a GPT-style autoregressive model with 4 decoder layers and causal self-attention masking.\n","\n","2. _Compile Model:_ Uses Adam optimizer (learning rate 5e-4), sparse categorical cross-entropy loss, and accuracy metric for next-token prediction.\n","\n","3. _Summary:_ Displays the complete model architecture with ~4.15M trainable parameters.\n","\n","**Preparing the Data:**\n","\n","_Autoregressive Sequence Setup:_\n","\n","1. Input sequences (y_train_in, y_val_in): All tokens except the last one (used as context for prediction).\n","\n","2. Target sequences (y_train_out, y_val_out): All tokens except the first one (what the model should predict next).\n","\n","This shift-by-one setup enables the decoder-only model to learn next-token prediction autoregressively.\n","\n","_Dataset Pipelines with Performance Optimization:_\n","\n","The training and validation datasets use `prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)` to pipeline data loading and model execution, eliminating I/O bottlenecks and maximizing GPU utilization. The shuffle buffer is reduced to 5,000 to speed up shuffling operations.\n","\n","**Early Stopping Implementation:**\n","\n","_Early Stopping Callback:_\n","\n","1. Monitors validation loss with patience reduced to 3 epochs (from 5) to terminate training sooner when validation stops improving.\n","\n","2. restore_best_weights=True ensures optimal model recovery.\n","\n","3. Prevents wasted computation on Kaggle's time-limited environment.\n","\n","_Model Checkpoint:_\n","\n","1. Saves the best model to 'best_transformer_model.keras' for recovery.\n","\n","2. Ensures the best-performing version is preserved.\n","\n","_ReduceLROnPlateau Callback (New):_\n","\n","1. Automatically reduces learning rate by 50% when validation loss plateaus.\n","\n","2. Patience of 2 epochs enables quick adaptation to training dynamics.\n","\n","3. Minimum learning rate of 1e-6 prevents the learning rate from becoming too small.\n","\n","4. Helps the model escape local minima and converge faster.\n","\n","_Model Training:_ The decoder-only model trains with all three callbacks (early stopping, checkpoint, and learning rate reduction) to optimize training efficiency. The causal self-attention mechanism ensures each position can only attend to previous positions, enabling proper autoregressive generation. Expected training time on Kaggle: **3-4 hours** with 24K samples and 40 epochs.\n","\n","**Model Evaluation:**\n","\n","_Test Set Evaluation:_ The model is evaluated on the test set with prefetched batches for fast evaluation, providing accuracy and loss metrics.\n","\n","**Plotting Accuracy and Loss:**\n","\n","_Visualization:_ Training and validation curves show:\n","- Left subplot: Accuracy evolution showing learning progress.\n","- Right subplot: Loss evolution demonstrating optimization and convergence.\n","\n","These plots validate that early stopping and learning rate reduction are working effectively.\n","- **Dataset:** 24K samples (8K per language) for robust multilingual learning\n","- **Vocabulary:** 10K words per language for efficient processing\n","- **Sequence Length:** 30 tokens for optimal context vs. speed balance\n","- **Architecture:** Decoder-only with 4 layers and causal self-attention (~4.15M parameters)\n","- **Embedding Dimension:** 128 for efficient representation learning\n","- **Training Time:** Expected 3-4 hours on Kaggle for quality results\n","- **Embedding Dim:** 50% smaller (128 vs 256) → ~2x faster\n","- **Training Time:** Expected 2-3 hours on Kaggle with improved model quality"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"id":"8e4911c8","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-10T19:48:04.952709Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-10T19:48:04.952492Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-10T21:42:17.832649Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-10T21:42:17.831728Z"},"papermill":{"duration":6852.889458,"end_time":"2025-11-10T21:42:17.834647","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-11-10T19:48:04.945189","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/keras/src/layers/layer.py:877: UserWarning: Layer 'positional_encoding' (of type PositionalEncoding) was passed an input with a mask attached to it.

Here's a comprehensive breakdown of each function and process:\n","\n","**1. compute_exact_match Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function calculates the exact match score between the reference (actual) continuation and the predicted (generated) continuation, measuring word-by-word accuracy.\n","\n","_Steps:_\n","\n","- Tokenizes both the reference and hypothesis texts into words.\n","\n","- Compares words position-by-position to count matches.\n","\n","- Computes the match ratio by dividing matches by the maximum length of either sequence.\n","\n","- Returns: A float value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates perfect prediction and 0 indicates no matches.\n","\n","**2. compute_bleu Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function calculates the BLEU score, a standard metric for evaluating machine-generated text by comparing n-gram overlap with reference text.\n","\n","_Steps:_\n","\n","- Converts both reference and hypothesis texts to token sequences using the language-specific tokenizer.\n","\n","- Applies smoothing (method1) to handle cases with small n-grams, preventing zero scores for partial matches.\n","\n","- Uses the sentence_bleu function to compute the score based on unigram, bigram, trigram, and 4-gram overlaps.\n","\n","- Returns: The BLEU score, which measures how similar the generated text is to the reference on multiple n-gram levels.\n","\n","**3. get_seed_and_continuation Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function extracts both a seed lyric and its actual continuation from the dataset, enabling evaluation against ground truth.\n","\n","_Steps:_\n","\n","- Filters the dataset based on the specified language to ensure language-appropriate evaluation.\n","\n","- Randomly selects a lyric entry from the filtered data.\n","\n","- Splits the lyric into seed_words (the prompt) and continuation_words (the ground truth).\n","\n","- Handles edge cases where lyrics are too short by adjusting seed and continuation lengths dynamically.\n","\n","- Returns: A tuple containing (seed_text, actual_continuation), where the seed is used for prediction and the continuation serves as the reference for evaluation.\n","\n","**4. generate_text_exact Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function generates exact next lyrics using the Transformer model, predicting what actually comes next rather than paraphrasing the input.\n","\n","_Steps:_\n","\n","- Tokenizes and pads the seed text to match the model's expected input dimensions.\n","\n","- Initializes the decoder input with the seed sequence.\n","\n","- Iteratively predicts the next token for the specified number of words:\n","  - Uses the model to predict probability distributions over the vocabulary.\n","  - Applies temperature scaling to control prediction diversity (lower temperature = more conservative, higher = more creative).\n","  - Performs greedy decoding by selecting the most probable token at each step.\n","  - Stops generation if end-of-sequence token (<eos>) or padding is encountered.\n","  - Updates the decoder input with each newly generated token for autoregressive prediction.\n","\n","- Filters out special tokens (<sos>, <eos>, <OOV>) from the final output.\n","\n","- Returns: The generated text as a string containing only the predicted continuation.\n","\n","**5. Evaluation Loop and Metric Computation:**\n","\n","The code iterates over all supported languages (en, fr, ar) and performs comprehensive evaluation:\n","\n","_For each language:_\n","\n","- Tests with multiple samples (num_samples=3) to ensure robust evaluation across different contexts.\n","\n","- For each sample:\n","  - Retrieves a seed text and its actual continuation from the dataset using get_seed_and_continuation.\n","  - Displays the seed and actual continuation for transparency.\n","  - Generates predicted lyrics using generate_text_exact with temperature-controlled sampling.\n","  - Computes both exact match score and BLEU score to evaluate prediction quality from different perspectives.\n","  - Displays individual scores for each sample, allowing inspection of performance variation.\n","\n","- Aggregates scores across all samples and computes average metrics:\n","  - Average Exact Match: Indicates how many words were predicted correctly on average.\n","  - Average BLEU Score: Measures overall n-gram overlap quality across samples.\n","\n","_Outputs:_\n","\n","- For each sample: seed text, actual continuation, predicted continuation, exact match score, and BLEU score.\n","\n","- For each language: average exact match score and average BLEU score, providing a summary of the model's prediction accuracy.\n","\n","- This comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the model's ability to predict exact lyric continuations rather than paraphrase, with quantitative metrics validating performance across multiple languages and contexts.\n","\n","**Key Improvements Over Previous Approach:**\n","\n","- **Exact Prediction vs. Paraphrasing:** The model now predicts what comes next in the actual lyrics, not a rephrase of the input.\n","\n","- **Ground Truth Evaluation:** Uses actual continuations from the dataset as references, enabling objective quality assessment.\n","\n","- **Dual Metrics:** Combines exact match (word-level accuracy) with BLEU score (n-gram similarity) for comprehensive evaluation.\n","\n","- **Temperature Control:** Allows tuning between conservative (more accurate) and creative (more diverse) predictions.\n","\n","- **Multi-Sample Testing:** Averages across multiple samples per language to ensure reliable performance estimates."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"id":"7db17649","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-10T21:42:41.671421Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-10T21:42:41.671096Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-10T21:42:48.996837Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-10T21:42:48.995664Z"},"papermill":{"duration":11.315559,"end_time":"2025-11-10T21:42:48.998714","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-11-10T21:42:37.683155","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["================================================================================\n","LYRIC PREDICTION EVALUATION (Exact Match)\n","================================================================================\n","\n","================================================================================\n","Language: EN\n","================================================================================\n","\n","Sample 1:\n","Seed text: girl first time i saw you i changed my behavior\n","Actual continuation: i thaught you were the one at the same time\n","Predicted continuation: wait how i when <OOV> turned loosing so how\n","Exact Match Score: 0.0000\n","BLEU Score: 0.0255\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Sample 2:\n","Seed text: you speak more than you think and think less than\n","Actual continuation: anyone believes inert futility this numbing paradox that screams where\n","Predicted continuation: <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> girl the <OOV> the tho\n","Exact Match Score: 0.0000\n","BLEU Score: 0.0506\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Sample 3:\n","Seed text: outside my window theres a whole lot of trouble comin\n","Actual continuation: the cartoon killers and the rag cover clones stack heels\n","Predicted continuation: high lakes playin memory memory i cause\n","Exact Match Score: 0.0000\n","BLEU Score: 0.0000\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","EN -
