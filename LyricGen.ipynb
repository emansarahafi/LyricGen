Encoder Input:**\n","The enc_inputs placeholder is defined to take the input sequence for the encoder (shape (None,)), which can handle sequences of variable length.\n","\n","**2. Encoder Embeddings:**\n","The input is passed through an embedding layer (enc_embeddings) that converts each token into a dense vector representation. The mask_zero=True ensures padding tokens are ignored during processing.\n","\n","**3. Positional Encoding for Encoder:**\n","Positional encoding is added to the embeddings using the PositionalEncoding layer. This helps the model understand the position of each token in the sequence.\n","\n","**4. Encoder Layers:**\n","The encoder output is processed through a series of Transformer encoder layers, the number of which is specified by num_encoder_layers. Each layer consists of multi-head attention and a feed-forward network.\n","\n","**5. Decoder Input:**\n","The dec_inputs placeholder takes the input sequence for the decoder, similar to the encoder inputs.\n","\n","**6. Decoder Embeddings:**\n","The decoder input is passed through an embedding layer (dec_embeddings), followed by positional encoding (dec_pos_encoding), which is added to the embeddings to include positional information.\n","\n","**7. Decoder Layers:**\n","The decoder output is processed through a series of Transformer decoder layers, the number of which is specified by num_decoder_layers. Each layer takes the current decoder output and the encoder output as inputs (to perform cross-attention).\n","\n","**8. Output Layer:**\n","A dense layer with a softmax activation function is used to predict the next token in the sequence, outputting probabilities across the entire vocabulary (vocab_size).\n","\n","**9. Return:**\n","The function returns a Keras model that takes a single input sequence and outputs next-token predictions, forming a complete decoder-only Transformer (GPT-style architecture)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"id":"aeaab2c5","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-10T18:25:12.608453Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-10T18:25:12.608008Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-10T18:25:12.613458Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-10T18:25:12.61278Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.014075,"end_time":"2025-11-10T18:25:12.615031","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-11-10T18:25:12.600956","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["def build_decoder_only_transformer(vocab_size, embed_dim, num_heads, ff_dim, max_len, num_layers, dropout_rate):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Build a decoder-only Transformer model (GPT-style) for autoregressive text generation.\n","    This architecture is simpler and more appropriate for lyric prediction tasks.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    # Input\n","    inputs = Input(shape=(None,), name=\"Input\")\n","    \n","    # Token Embeddings\n","    embeddings = Embedding(vocab_size, embed_dim, mask_zero=True, name=\"Token_Embedding\")(inputs)\n","    \n","    # Positional Encoding\n","    pos_encoding = PositionalEncoding(max_len, embed_dim)(embeddings)\n","    embeddings += pos_encoding\n","\n","    # Decoder Layers (with causal masking for autoregressive generation)\n","    output = embeddings\n","    for i in range(num_layers):\n","        decoder_layer = transformer_decoder_layer(\n","            embed_dim, num_heads, ff_dim, dropout_rate, \n","            layer_name=f\"Decoder_Layer_{i+1}\"\n","        )\n","        output = decoder_layer(output)\n","\n","    # Output Layer (predicts next token probabilities)\n","    outputs = Dense(vocab_size, activation=\"softmax\", name=\"Output_Layer\")(output)\n","\n","    return Model(inputs, outputs, name=\"DecoderOnly_Transformer\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ffd20200","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.005965,"end_time":"2025-11-10T18:25:12.627079","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-11-10T18:25:12.621114","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# **5.

Here's a comprehensive breakdown of each function and process:\n","\n","**1. compute_exact_match Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function calculates the exact match score between the reference (actual) continuation and the predicted (generated) continuation, measuring word-by-word accuracy.\n","\n","_Steps:_\n","\n","- Tokenizes both the reference and hypothesis texts into words.\n","\n","- Compares words position-by-position to count matches.\n","\n","- Computes the match ratio by dividing matches by the maximum length of either sequence.\n","\n","- Returns: A float value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates perfect prediction and 0 indicates no matches.\n","\n","**2. compute_bleu Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function calculates the BLEU score, a standard metric for evaluating machine-generated text by comparing n-gram overlap with reference text.\n","\n","_Steps:_\n","\n","- Converts both reference and hypothesis texts to token sequences using the language-specific tokenizer.\n","\n","- Applies smoothing (method1) to handle cases with small n-grams, preventing zero scores for partial matches.\n","\n","- Uses the sentence_bleu function to compute the score based on unigram, bigram, trigram, and 4-gram overlaps.\n","\n","- Returns: The BLEU score, which measures how similar the generated text is to the reference on multiple n-gram levels.\n","\n","**3. get_seed_and_continuation Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function extracts both a seed lyric and its actual continuation from the dataset, enabling evaluation against ground truth.\n","\n","_Steps:_\n","\n","- Filters the dataset based on the specified language to ensure language-appropriate evaluation.\n","\n","- Randomly selects a lyric entry from the filtered data.\n","\n","- Splits the lyric into seed_words (the prompt) and continuation_words (the ground truth).\n","\n","- Handles edge cases where lyrics are too short by adjusting seed and continuation lengths dynamically.\n","\n","- Returns: A tuple containing (seed_text, actual_continuation), where the seed is used for prediction and the continuation serves as the reference for evaluation.\n","\n","**4. generate_text_exact Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function generates exact next lyrics using the Transformer model, predicting what actually comes next rather than paraphrasing the input.\n","\n","_Steps:_\n","\n","- Tokenizes and pads the seed text to match the model's expected input dimensions.\n","\n","- Initializes the decoder input with the seed sequence.\n","\n","- Iteratively predicts the next token for the specified number of words:\n","  - Uses the model to predict probability distributions over the vocabulary.\n","  - Applies temperature scaling to control prediction diversity (lower temperature = more conservative, higher = more creative).\n","  - Performs greedy decoding by selecting the most probable token at each step.\n","  - Stops generation if end-of-sequence token (<eos>) or padding is encountered.\n","  - Updates the decoder input with each newly generated token for autoregressive prediction.\n","\n","- Filters out special tokens (<sos>, <eos>, <OOV>) from the final output.\n","\n","- Returns: The generated text as a string containing only the predicted continuation.\n","\n","**5. Evaluation Loop and Metric Computation:**\n","\n","The code iterates over all supported languages (en, fr, ar) and performs comprehensive evaluation:\n","\n","_For each language:_\n","\n","- Tests with multiple samples (num_samples=3) to ensure robust evaluation across different contexts.\n","\n","- For each sample:\n","  -

The predict_next_lyrics function serves as a user-friendly wrapper around the generation model, making it easy to experiment with different inputs and languages.\n","\n","**predict_next_lyrics Function:**\n","\n","_Purpose:_ This function allows users to input their own seed lyrics and generate predictions in any supported language, with control over generation parameters.\n","\n","_Parameters:_\n","\n","1. **seed_text (str):** The starting lyrics or prompt text that the model will use as context for prediction.\n","\n","2. **language (str):** Language code specifying which language model to use ('en' for English, 'fr' for French, 'ar' for Arabic).\n","\n","3. **num_words (int):** The number of words to predict following the seed text, allowing control over generation length.\n","\n","4. **temperature (float):** Controls prediction randomness:\n","   - Lower values (e.g., 0.5-0.7): More conservative, predictable outputs that closely follow training patterns.\n","   - Higher values (e.g., 0.9-1.2): More creative, diverse outputs with increased variability.\n","   - Default (0.8): Balanced between accuracy and creativity.\n","\n","_Processing Steps:_\n","\n","1. **Language Validation:** Checks if the requested language is supported and provides helpful feedback if not.\n","\n","2. **Text Cleaning:** Applies language-specific cleaning rules to the seed text:\n","   - English: Removes special characters, converts to lowercase.\n","   - French: Preserves accented characters (À-ÿ), converts to lowercase.\n","   - Arabic: Preserves Arabic Unicode characters (\\u0600-\\u06FF), maintains original case.\n","\n","3. **Whitespace Normalization:** Removes extra spaces to ensure clean input formatting.\n","\n","4. **Generation:** Calls generate_text_exact with the cleaned seed and specified parameters.\n","\n","5. **Output Display:** Shows the seed, language, prediction details, and complete generated lyrics.\n","\n","_Returns:_ The predicted continuation as a string, which can be used programmatically or simply displayed.\n","\n","**Example Demonstrations:**\n","\n","The code includes three example predictions demonstrating the function's capabilities:\n","\n","1. **English Example:** \"I want to hold your\" → predicts 8 words with temperature 0.7\n","   - Demonstrates the model's ability to continue common English lyric patterns.\n","\n","2. **French Example:** \"je suis avec toi\" (I am with you) → predicts 8 words with temperature 0.7\n","   - Shows multilingual support and French language generation.\n","\n","3. **Arabic Example:** \"أنا معك\" (I am with you) → predicts 8 words with temperature 0.7\n","   - Validates right-to-left language handling and Arabic script generation.\n","\n","**User Instructions:**\n","\n","After running the examples, users can call predict_next_lyrics() with their own custom seed text, choosing their preferred language and generation parameters. This interactive approach makes the model accessible for creative experimentation and practical lyric generation tasks.\n","\n","**Practical Use Cases:**\n","\n","- **Songwriting Assistance:** Generate continuation ideas for lyrics in progress.\n","- **Language Learning:** Explore natural language patterns in multiple languages.\n","- **Creative Exploration:** Experiment with different temperatures to find the right balance between predictability and novelty.\n","- **Comparative Analysis:** Test the same seed across different languages to observe multilingual generation differences."]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"nvidiaTeslaT4","dataSources":[{"datasetId":2805070,"sourceId":4840139,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":30787,"isGpuEnabled":true,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.14"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":3552.791325,"end_time":"2025-11-10T19:20:04.455406","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2025-11-10T18:20:51.664081","version":"2.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
